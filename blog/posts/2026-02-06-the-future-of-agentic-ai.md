## The Rise of Agentic AI

The AI landscape is shifting. We are moving beyond simple chat interfaces to **Agentic Workflows**. Unlike traditional LLMs that respond to prompts in a single turn, agentic AI systems can plan, reason, and execute multi-step tasks autonomously.

### Why Agents Matter

1.  **Autonomous Planning**: Agents can break down a complex goal into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
2.  **Tool Use**: They can interact with external tools, APIs, and databases to fetch real-time information or perform actions.
3.  **Self-Correction**: Agents can evaluate their own output and refine their approach if they encounter errors.

### The Path Forward

As we integrate these agents into our daily workflows, the focus will shift from "how to prompt" to "how to orchestrate". We are entering an era of collaborative intelligence where human intent is amplified by agentic execution.

Stay tuned as I explore more about building and deploying these systems!
